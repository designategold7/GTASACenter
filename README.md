Core functionalities include:
* Player Stat modification (health, money, etc.)
* Vehicle Spawner
* Weapon Editor and Spawner
* In-game Time and Weather control

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the tool running.

### Prerequisites

* A compatible version of Microsoft Windows (XP or later).
* Visual Basic 6 runtime libraries.
* An installed copy of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (v1.0 or v1.01).

### Installation

1.  Download the latest compiled binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/designategold7/GTASACenter/releases) page.
2.  Extract the archive's contents into a new folder.
3.  Run `GTASAConsole.exe`, preferably with administrator privileges.

## Usage

Using it with cracked executables, script mods (SCM), or other game versions is not supported and will likely lead to game instability, crashes, or save file corruption. Use at your own risk.
