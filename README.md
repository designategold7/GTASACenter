The console is mission independant. You can change only global values with the console. However, if you are using any crack, or modded scm, please do not use the console. Most of the memory locations are different. Some functions might still work, but mainly, the console will either crash gta sa sooner or later, or completely damage your ongoing game.

New functionality in Version 1.8.2:

Minor fix on the Player Specialities has been fixed. The Player Specs now gets 'locked' properly.

New functionality in Version 1.8.1:
The weapon proficiencies are now handled and edited separately.
The current car and player specs gets checked again after cut-scenes.
The TANK MODE is back in the console, with an internal console command to set ON/OFF.
The teleport locations are handled with 6 decimals after comma, making up to a few inches accuracy on teleporting.
The tag locations are added to the location list.
The ability to lock the cheats is also back in console, so the cheats like 'Never Wanted' does not get cleared after some cut-scenes.
About 20 more console commands are also added to avoid the alt-tab out of the game to use the console.
The girl-friend progresses does now work properly (after you set the pct to 100, you still need to date the GF once to get the 100 pct gift from the GF).
You can now edit/change the game time freely without the gta sa loses the time/date syncronization (ie. the console now tracks the current date, weekday as well as current date and time).
You can now freely edit the game speed and clock speed using the sliders and with new console commands.
The teleport locations list gets sorted during save to config, so that the teleport to next and teleport to previous location console commands work now properly.
